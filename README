This is an attempt to map usecases, vocabularies, topics from the work of 
the W3C Incubator group on Library Linked Data [1].

I began making this during the meeting in Pittsburgh on 23/10/2010

Installation:

(this will use a file-based sqlite database - configured in config/database.yml)

0. git clone http://github.com/paulwalk/lldvis.git
1. cd lldvis
2. cp config/database.yml.tmpl config/database.yml
3. rake db:create
4. rake db:migrate
5. rake db:seed
6. ruby script/server
7. http://localhost:3000
